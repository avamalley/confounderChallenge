## The Hidden Confounder: Patient Severity Explains It All

As readers of @fig-plot-outcomes, the easiest path for our brains is to accept the mental model of surgical outcomes depicted in @fig-example-node.

![DAG Model Explaining Surgical Outcomes](dag-example-node.png){#fig-example-node width=50%}

The obvious conclusion from using the mental model of @fig-example-node and the data shown in @fig-plot-outcomes is that **Doc Dreamy is the superior surgeon because his patients' scores are lower than Doc Duck's patients' scores**.

However, a "common cause" confounder can create an association between $X$ and $Y$ that is not causal in nature. For example, if $X$ is puddles on the road and $Y$ is people with umbrellas, it does not mean that the puddles cause people to have umbrellas. Instead, a common cause for both, namely rain ($Z$), is the sole reason for the observed association. The presence of rain causes both puddles and people to carry umbrellas, creating a spurious correlation between the two.

As Nassim Taleb hints, there may be an alternate explanation. Consider the model shown in @fig-example2-node.  Might there be an unaccounted for common cause that is causing the association between surgeon choice and surgical outcomes?

![DAG Model Explaining Surgical Outcomes](dag-example2-node.png){#fig-example2-node width=50%}

A possible common-cause story would go something like this. Both surgeons have full schedules, with Dr. Dreamy scheduling surgeries 3 weeks in advance and Dr. Duck scheduling surgeries 1 week in advance. As such, patients who are not in a rush, usually those with low severity, are more likely to choose Dr. Dreamy based on his website and picture. However, patients who are in more of a rush, usually those with high severity, are more likely to choose Dr. Duck based on his availability and the fact that he is the only surgeon who can see them immediately.

## Randomization — Break the Confounding Path

The gold standard to establish causation is a randomized controlled trial. Instead of letting patients choose their surgeon, we randomly assign them to either Dr. Dreamy or Dr. Duck.

This is precisely the kind of problem randomization can solve. By randomly assigning patients to surgeons, we break the potential confounding relationship where patient severity ends up correlated with choice of surgeon. Since assignment is now random rather than based on patient choice between a good-looking doctor and a doctor available more quickly, we eliminate this confounding pathway. This break, pictured in @fig-example3-node, allows us to assess whether surgeon identity truly matters for surgical success, or if the observed association was merely due to patient severity influencing both surgeon choice and outcomes.

![DAG Model Explaining Surgical Outcomes](dag-example3-node.png){#fig-example3-node width=65%}


@fig-example3-node shows the DAG model for the randomization scenario. In this scenario, patient severity ($Z$) is no longer a cause of surgeon choice ($X$). Instead, randomization ($R$) completely determines surgeon assignment ($X$). This breaks the confounding relationship between patient severity and surgeon choice, allowing us to assess whether the surgeons themselves truly matter for surgical outcomes.

### Our data doesn't have counterfactuals, how can we know what would have happened to those patients if we had randomized?


Unfortunately, we can't observe what didn't happen. The patients we already observed went to the surgeon they chose (or who was available), and we'll never know their outcomes under the alternative assignment. This is the fundamental problem of causal inference: we only see one world, not the parallel universe where everything else was held constant but the treatment differed.

Since we cannot rerun history with randomization, we run an experiment to collect the data we need. So, we randomly assigned a sequence of 100 patients to either Dr. Dreamy or Dr. Duck and observed the following data:

        'severity': np.random.normal(0, 1, n_patients_randomized)
    })
    .assign(
        # Randomly assign doctors: 50/50 chance, independent of severity

        # Assign doctor names based on id
        doctor_name=lambda df: np.where(df['doctor_id'] == 1, 'Doc Dreamy', 'Doc Duck'),
        # Assign surgical goodness:
        # Doc Duck: Normal(0.5, 1), Doc Dreamy: Normal(-0.4, 1)
        # Same true effect as before - Doc Duck is better
        surgicalGoodness=lambda df: np.where(
            df['doctor_name'] == 'Doc Duck',
            np.random.normal(0.5, 1, n_patients_randomized),
            np.random.normal(-0.4, 1, n_patients_randomized)
        ),
        # Calculate post-surgical severity: initial severity - surgical goodness + 3
        post_surgical_score=lambda df: df['severity'] - df['surgicalGoodness'] + 3
    )
)

## Stratification — When You Can't Randomize

The key to handling a common cause confounder is to stratify by the common cause. In general, this means we examine the relationship between treatment and outcome within groups that share the same value of the confounder. In our example, this means we look at patients of similar severity and compare the outcomes of the surgeons for patients of similar severity. There are mathematically sophisticated ways to do this, but here we demonstrate it visually. Since patient number lacks inherent meaning, the following figure shows patient severity on the x-axis and post-surgical symptom score on the y-axis.

## The solution: Randomization when you can, stratification when you can't

Here's the problem with graphs and statistics in general: the numbers can easily mislead you. Or rather, you can be misled *by* the numbers when you don't understand what they're really telling you.

When you just look at the raw data and ask who had better outcomes, Doc Dreamy wins. Lower scores look great on paper. But here's where it gets important: that association doesn't mean what you think it means. Correlation is not causation, and we all know that, but we forget it every single time because our brains are wired to see patterns and assign causes.

The real villain here is patient severity. It operates like a puppeteer behind the curtain, making Doc Dreamy look good by sending him easier cases while sending Doc Duck the harder ones. When you don't randomize, you can't tell the difference between "Doc Dreamy is a better surgeon" and "Doc Dreamy got lucky with his patient assignment."  On any graph or in any headline, look for the common-cause-confounder villian that is unaccounted for.

Randomization is an excellent defense against this kind of confounding. Flip a coin, assign patients randomly, and suddenly the puppeteer loses control. Now you can actually see who the better surgeon is. And the surprise is that it's the one who doesn't look the part. The data wasn't lying; it was just answering a different question than you thought you were asking.

If you can't randomize, and that's most of the time, you stratify. Look within groups of similar patient severity. Compare apples to apples, not apples to oranges. It's more work, and it's less satisfying than a clean randomized trial, but it's better than being fooled by confounding.

The take-home lesson: The world is messy, and the numbers will mislead you if you let them. But if you understand the structure of the problem, if you draw the DAG and think about what causes what, you can defend yourself against being fooled. Randomization when you can, stratification when you can't. The tools are simple. The hard part is remembering to use them.
